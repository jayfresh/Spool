SPOOL
=====

A JavaScript library for offline-first web apps.

Aims:
- to assume the browser is offline by default
- a drop-in library that allows your existing JS to continue to work (jQuery only? or wrappers?)
- essentially: DropBox for AJAX
- when GETing, everything comes from the cache
- when PUTing, everything is PUt to the cache and that then syncs
- any changes in the remote data storage are synced to the cache whenever possible
- if there are conflicts between local data and remote data, we'll handle that in some way (Tony Garnock-Jones' JS diff'ing implementation comes to mind)
- to be used for a set of data you can list, so it's like a folder, not for all AJAX requests
